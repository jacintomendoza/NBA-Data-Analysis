This method can lead to better accuracy as it splits players that average above 30% from the 3-pointer line from players that average 30% from the 3-pointer line.  Most PG average above 30% from 3 so this narrows down that are less likey to be a PG.

This method also doesn't include low-playing games as these values can vary a lot due to inconclusive data.  With more per individual player, we are able to receive more accurate, averaged/consilidated data.
